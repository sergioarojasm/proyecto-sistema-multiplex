# Multiplex Management System in C++
This was the final project for the Algorithmic Thinking course in the 2016-1 period of the Electronics Engineering program at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogot√° D.C., Colombia. A platform was implemented through which the entire management of a multiplex cinema can be carried out, from checking movies at the box office to available seats, among others.
